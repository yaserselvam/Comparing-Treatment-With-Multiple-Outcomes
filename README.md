# Comparing Treatment With Multiple Outcomes Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a series of R scripts developed to illustrate various aspects of hypothesis testing, particularly focusing on Type I and Type II errors, their trade-offs, and visualizations related to bivariate distributions and hypothesis testing under different conditions. These scripts are ideal for educational purposes, providing clear visual examples of statistical concepts.

## Scripts Description

The repository includes the following R scripts:

1. **Bivariate Hypothesis Regions with Maximized Type I Error**
   - Demonstrates how to configure hypothesis testing regions to maximize the Type I error in a bivariate setting.

2. **Bivariate Normal Distribution with Type I Error Region**
   - Visualizes a bivariate normal distribution with regions that illustrate the Type I error.

3. **High Correlation: Null (blue) vs. Alternative (red)**
   - Plots distributions under the null and alternative hypotheses, emphasizing scenarios with high correlation.

4. **Hypothesis Regions for Bivariate Test - Maximizing Type II Error**
   - Focuses on the configuration of hypothesis regions to maximize the Type II error in bivariate tests.

8. **Null (Blue) vs. Alternative (Red) Hypothesis Distributions**
   - Compares the distributions under null and alternative hypotheses with clear color-coded visualizations.

9. **Null vs. Alternative Hypothesis Distributions for a Right-Tailed Test**
   - Special focus on right-tailed tests comparing null and alternative hypothesis distributions.

12. **Two Primary Endpoints with Co-Primary Outcome**
    - Explores hypothesis testing with two primary endpoints and a co-primary outcome scenario.
